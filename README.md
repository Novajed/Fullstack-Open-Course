### [Full stack open 2020 - Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

This repository contains all of my exercise submissions from the course linked above( which has been delightful so far üòÅ)

Loosely following the course's recommendations, each part has its own directory, which contains the corresponding exercises(will rearrange/rename if and when the need arises), e.g. :

```
part1
  New note_0.4.png
  New note_0.4.md
  Single page app_0.5
  New note_0.6
```

If deemed necessary, a Markdown file with a name matching the exercise file will be included for clarity.

In addition to making course submissions, the purpose of the repo is to:

- Spread the word about this amazing course
- Keep track of my progress
- Raise my productivity
- Increase my green squares because I'm vain

Thank you to [Matti Luukkainen](https://github.com/mluukkai), [Terveystalo](https://www.terveystalo.com/fi/Yritystietoa/Terveystalo-tyontantajana/Digital-Health/) and the [many other contributors](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/misc/blob/master/contributors.md) for providing this course. I've only started yesterday( Aug 27 2020 ) and have already benefitted immensely from the material.

I'd recommend anyone who reads this to check it out yourself and have fun!
